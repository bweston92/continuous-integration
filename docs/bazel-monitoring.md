# How to monitor for Bazel regressions

This is a guide for the Bazel build sheriff about monitoring the Bazel CI
(Continuous Integration) projects and jobs.

# The CI dashboard

URL: https://ci.bazel.io/view/Dashboard/

The dashboard gives a quick overview of the Bazel CI's health.

We monitor:

*   Bazel's own jobs (owned by the core Bazel team):

    -   [bazel-tests](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel-tests)
    -   [bazel-slow-tests](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel-slow-tests)
    -   [bazel-remote-tests](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel-remote-tests)
    -   [Tutorial](https://ci.bazel.io/job/Tutorial)
    -   [benchmark](https://ci.bazel.io/job/benchmark)
    -   [nightly](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel/job/nightly)
    -   [release](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel/job/release)

*   Projects built using Bazel:

    -   repositories on the bazelbuild GitHub organisation, e.g. rules\_web
    -   TensorFlow
    -   Gerrit
    -   protobuf
    -   re2
    -   ...

If Bazel's own jobs are not green, the Bazel team must:

1.  investigate
2.  fix as soon as possible

If the other projects are not green:

1.  report it to the project owners
2.  deactivate the project if it stays broken for more than a week

# Triaging failures

The build sheriff should monitor the outputs of these types of jobs:

*   [global tests](user.md#global-jobs)
*   benchmark
*   [postsubmits](user.md#postsubmit)

## Global tests

URLs:

*   nightly: https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel/job/nightly
*   release: https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel/job/release

When do these jobs run:

*   [nightly](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel/job/nightly): runs every night and
    can be re-run on demand using the Run button in Jenkins (you need to log in
    on the Jenkins UI)
*   [release](https://ci.bazel.io/job/bazel/job/release): runs at every push and
    is always green for non-release pushes

How to investigate: see the [user guide](user.md#global-jobs).

When global tests fail badly:

1.  [file a bug to bazelbuild/bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new)
2.  add the "breakage" label to the bug
3.  add the "release blocker" label if the breakage is on the release job

## Benchmark

URL: https://ci.bazel.io/job/benchmark

How to investigate: look at the output logs:

*   if the job fails with a java error or build error: [file a bug to
    bazelbuild/bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/new)
*   otherwise: [file a bug to
    bazelbuild/continuous-integration](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/continuous-integration/new)

## Postsubmits

These are all the other monitored jobs.

To investigate:

How to investigate: see the [user guide](user.md#presubmit).

1.  report to the project owner (e.g. Bazel team for "bazel-tests")
2.  deactivate partially or totally, if a failure stays for too long
